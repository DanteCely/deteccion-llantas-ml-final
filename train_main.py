    # Steps for training the model:
    #   1. Choose train and test data, guarantee that both groups are balanced
    #   2. Instantiate each of the models to train
    #   3. Set hiperparameters and optimization strategy (Gradient descent - ADAM)
    #   4. Train the models
    #   5. Compute confusion matrix with test dataset
    #   6. Compare results
